                    Carl Sagan was a prominent figure in the 20th century due to his unique ability to make science
                    accessible and enjoyable to the public. Not only was he a writer and scientist, but he was also a
                    fierce advocate for scientific education and rationality. Sagan worked closely with NASA and
                    contributed to missions like Voyager, which sent messages into space containing information about
                    human civilization. He strongly believed that humanity should strive for exploration and seek life
                    beyond Earth, emphasizing the importance of preserving Earth as the "pale blue dot" we know so far.

                    Played a key role in developing the golden records sent by NASA with the Voyager probes to represent
                    Earth to other worlds.
                    Co-founded the Planetary Society, a nonprofit organization that supports space exploration.

                      way of communicating scientific concepts. His role as the director of the Hayden Planetarium in
                      New York City has allowed him to reach millions of space enthusiasts. His show StarTalk features
                      fascinating conversations that blend science and pop culture, discussing topics related to space
                      and science with personalities from various fields. Tyson is also known for openly challenging

                          Stephen Hawking was one of the most influential scientists of modern times, not only due to
                          his scientific achievements but also because of his inspiring personal life. Despite being
                          diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which left him unable to move or speak,
                          Hawking continued to develop his research on black holes and the origins of the universe. His
                          book A Brief History of Time is considered one of the best-selling science books worldwide and
                          succeeded in bringing complex ideas like time, the Big Bang, and black holes to the general
                          public. </p>

                          overcoming challenges.
                          His books, such as The Universe in a Nutshell and The Grand Design, were significant resources
                          for simplifying theoretical physics for the public.
